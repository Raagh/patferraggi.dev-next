          Over the past 7+ years, I â€˜ve created a great variety of high quality web business applications using
          technologies like C#, asp.net core, Node.js, Express.js, Angular, React.js using both JavaScript and
          TypeScript. I focus on software that is testable, maintainable, reusable and adaptive, requirements for
          success in Agile environments.
